This package provides examples programs to use the standalone TRAC-IK solver and related code.

Currently, there only exists an ik\_tests program that compares KDL's Pseudoinverse Jacobian IK solver with TRAC-IK.  The pr2_arm.launch files runs this test on the default PR2 robot's 7-DOF right arm chain.
